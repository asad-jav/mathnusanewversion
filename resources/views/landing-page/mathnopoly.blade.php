                    We’ve all heard that to learn math you must practice it. But doing it the traditional way of pen to paper is boring and doesn’t encourage students to practice. It’s also more difficult for teachers to assess progress individually and as a group.

                    Say goodbye to the boring way of handling homework/practicing your math skills. Introducing MATHNOPOLY. It’s the perfect fusion of two analytical games that kids enjoy, which makes doing homework – practicing math – more Fun.

                        As a combination of Fortnite and Monopoly, we have merged all the learning elements of both games to create math practice sessions that boost learning. <br>
                        They enhance all the skills students are tested on including:

                        How MATHNOPOLY Works to Enhance Learning Math

                    MATHNOPOLY is the equivalent of students doing their homework while playing a video game. But, instead of using a textbook or worksheet as a resource, they use creativity! <br><br>
                    Students select their grade level and “practice” math in a gamified form. The learning objective here is to have students fill in procedure gaps and test their computational skills in math. Following their sessions, they will later join the live instructional classes to “do” mathematics.  <br><br>
                    MATHNOPOLY will capture the data on correct/incorrect answers from the game and shares the data with the classroom instructor. This gives the Instructor and students the ability to see a scatter plot &/or tables of their session. Now, both your kids and their instructors can quickly identify the outliers of random guessing vs sound reasoning to enhance their learning.

                    Traditional practicing versus playing? Which one would your child choose? We know the answer. So, we keep them involved until they have mastered the logic of each level.
